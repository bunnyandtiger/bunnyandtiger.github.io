    1. Defrost the Tilapia in Lukewarm Water. Not cold water. You need to make
    sure it defrosts fully, or else the end result will taste fishy&nbsp;

    2. Spray non-stick skillet with PAM spray

    3. Cover both sides of Tilapia with light salt, pepper, oregano, and parsley
    flakes. only salt one side

    4. Cook on medium for 6 minutes on both sides. Do not move too much while
    cooking.

This recipe has been modified to use no butter - instead all of the fat comes from the PAM spray (and maybe some from the fish?)
