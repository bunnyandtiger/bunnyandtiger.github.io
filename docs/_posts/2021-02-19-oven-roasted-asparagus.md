    1. Take one bunch of asparagus and wash them thoroughly.

    2. Cut off one inch from bottom, cut off the white parts.

    3. Dry them thoroughly and put them on a baking tray with aluminum foil

    4. Coat them with 1/2 tbsp of oil, moving them around with hands to coat
    them very evenly.

    5. Salt them with small salt shaker.

    6. Pepper them, about 5 cranks per stick

    7. Put them on the bottom rack at 400 degrees. Does not need to preheat.
    When it's done, they should be slightly wrinkly and some of the foil should
    have browned.
