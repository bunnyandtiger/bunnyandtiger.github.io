    with a paper towel.

    3. Dip bottom 3/4 of strawberry in chocolate carefully, then place on baking
    tray lined with parchment paper.

    4. Immediately sprinkle toppings (chopped pistachio, coconut shreds)

Much better (and less expensive) than the store-bought ones. This recipe allows you to control the amount of chocolate you use and choose the toppings that you want to put\!

Bunny adapted this method from her original plan around chocolate-covered pretzels. Works well for both\!
