    1. Preheat to 400

    2. Take one bunch of asparagus and wash them thoroughly.

    3. Cut off one inch from bottom, cut off the white parts. Do not trim too
    much though.

    4. Dry them thoroughly (with paper towel, not dish towel as that leaks
    fibers) and put them on a baking tray with aluminum foil

    5. Coat them with 1/2 tbsp of olive oil, moving them around with hands to
    coat them very evenly.

    6. Salt them with small salt shaker.

    7. Pepper them, about 5 cranks per stick

    8. Put them on the bottom rack at 400 degrees for 30 min. When it's done,
    they should be slightly wrinkly and some of the foil should have browned.

    9. Some of the asparagus should have browned too. The greenest ones are the
    undercooked ones.
