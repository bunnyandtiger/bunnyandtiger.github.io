    1. Combine heavy cream with milk and a little bit of sugar in a medium
    saucepan. Bring to a simmer (or close to it) and then turn off the heat.

    2. In a separate bowl, whisk egg yolks with remaining sugar until thick and
    fluffy.&nbsp;

    3. Let cream mixture cool a bit and slowly ladle a third of it into the yolk
    mixture, whisking to ensure even mixing and to prevent eggs from cooking.

    4. Add yolk mixture to the cream mixture.

    5. Add entire can of red bean and whisk together.

    6. Cool to room temperature and then rest in fridge until chilled.

    7. Put in ice cream maker and let machine do its magic :)
