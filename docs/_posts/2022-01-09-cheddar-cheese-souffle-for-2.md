    1. In a small saucepan, melt butter. Once butter is melted, add in flour and
    combine.&nbsp;

    2. Very slowly add in milk. Mixture will first appear thick but will thin
    out once all of the milk has been added.&nbsp;

    3. Bring to a simmer and then cook on low heat until sauce has thickened.

    4. Once sauce has thickened, add in salt and pepper. Move everything to a
    separate mixing bowl and whisk together with egg yolk until well combined.

    5. In a separate mixing bowl, combine egg whites with cream of tartar and
    beat (with a hand-mixer) until stiff peaks form.

    6. Fold in egg whites into the rest of the mixture. Add cheese and cayenne.

    7. Divide into two separate ramekins and bake at 400 degrees for 18 minutes.
