  directions_markdown: >-
    1. Add 1/2 tbsp oil to wok and heat on low-medium for 1-2 minutes.

    2. Add 1/4 bulb of garlic and cook until fragrant. Please make sure NOT to
    have the oil too hot here, or else the garlic will start overcooking very
    quickly once it hits the oil and will likely be burnt.

    3. Add half of snow pea leaves to pan and stir around to ensure even
    cooking.

    4. Add salt a little bit at a time and stop when it tastes right. (usually
    around Â¼ tsp salt, or two passes of the small salt shaker)

    5. Remove cooked pea sprouts and repeat steps 2-4 for other half of leaves.
