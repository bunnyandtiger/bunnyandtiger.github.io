    1. Add oil to wok and heat on low-medium for 1-2 minutes. 

    2. Add garlic and cook until fragrant. Please make sure NOT to have the oil
    too hot here, or else the garlic will start overcooking very quickly once it
    hits the oil and will likely be burnt.

    3. Add half of snow pea leaves to pan and stir around to ensure even
    cooking. 

    4. Add salt a little bit at a time and stop when it tastes right. (usually
    around Â¼ tsp salt?)

    5. Add a tsp of shaoxing rice wine per batch 

    6. Remove cooked pea sprouts and repeat steps 2-4 for other half of leaves.
